<p>Principles and Practices</p>

<p>Digital Revolutions</p>

<p>Analogue to digital communication
Analogue to Digital computation
Analogue to digital fabrication</p>

<p>Gordon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a> - article, 1965, processors have been doubling in power every year</p>

<p>Connecting computers to machines, has a long history, MIT 1950’s</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, by suing a symbol to communicate you can communicate reliably with an unreliable devices</p>

<p>The meaning of digital is much more subtle, the father of information theory, by using a symbols.</p>

<p>###The casual meaning of Digital Fabrication</p>

<p>The casual meaning of digital fabrication is controlling machines to make things, the deep meaning is coding for the construction of materials themselves.</p>

<p>###Wikipedia</p>

<p>“In 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at MIT, where he worked on Vannevar Bush’s differential analyzer, an early analog computer. While studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed switching circuits based on Boole’s concepts. In 1937, he wrote his master’s degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits.”</p>

<p>Using this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon’s work became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II.</p>

<p>The Fablab today.</p>

<p>1000 fablabs, roughly one fablabs per city today. The Fablab we are in today is just like the minicomputer, which like one upon a time computers were used in workgroups before the advent of personal computers. So the Fablab is in essence like one machine.</p>

<p>The original Fablab was about a $100,000 investment.</p>

<p>One machine cannot do everything, but the collection of machines can used together can make almost anything.</p>

<p>All the amazing examples of fablabs. Floating fablabs. Belfast. Israel/Palestine</p>

<p>The Fablabas have grown in reach:</p>

<p>BioAcademy: How to Grow almost Anything!</p>

<p>FabAcademy, is a distributed educational network. The technology changes periodically in the labs but in a coordinated way.</p>

<p>Changing educational framework.</p>

<p>Seymour Paper, pioneer in</p>

<p>Barcelona and FabCities: creating sustainable cities. Have the city to sustainably produce what it consumes.</p>

<p>Fab14 in Toulouse</p>

<p>FabCity Summit in Paris 12 and 13 of July 2018
Fab Summit in Toulouse 16 to 20 of July
—</p>

<p>The goal is for Fablabs to make Fablabs:
We are at the end of purchasing fablabs and beginning, like the internet, curating a network where fablabs can make fablabs.</p>

<p>Father of computational architecture, a self-reproducing machine.</p>

<p>The research of machines making machines will take another 50 years.</p>

<p>Learning digital fabrication, but the bigger question is if anyone can make anything anywhere, then how does this affect society, governance?</p>
